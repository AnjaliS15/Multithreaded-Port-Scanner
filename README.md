# Multithreaded-Port-Scanner

Hey everyone! This is my latest project, where I have made a basic port scanner in C++ language.
This port scanner works on the concept of multithreaded the purpose of which is to make the 
scanning process faster. 

Prerequisites : 
  To understand this project below are some topics one must have some familiarity in - 
  1) Socket programming
  2) Threads in C++ and threading concepts
  3) UNderstanding of makefile
  4) Most importantly a passion for learning new things

I pondered on this project while learning this stuff in C++. There were a lot of new things I 
learned while doing this project. 

PS: This is NOT my original work, I did it to understand in depth how port scanner work and how real
    implementation of socket programming and multithreading work.
